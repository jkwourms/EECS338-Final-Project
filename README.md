# EECS338-Final-Project

Ok so Chris had some major edits:
"To make it more intuitive, please design it as follows: Customers are client processes that give different orders (different ingredient
requests) to a server. The server launches a separate thread that's a chef, while continuing to take orders. The chef takes time to
prepare each order (different times for different ingredients). When the server finally quits, it prints a log of all the orders."

# Final Steps!

* Have a set number defined in the server so that after X number of client connections to
the socket it says something like "restaurant is now closed" and closes the connection.
