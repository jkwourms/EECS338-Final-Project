# EECS338-Final-Project

# Final Steps!

* Have a set number defined in the server so that after X number of client connections to
the socket it says something like "restaurant is now closed" and closes the connection. 


# So here's what's up: 
I got the number working! Buuuut here are the catches:
* I couldn't get the newest version of the files to run, everytime I tried to connect the client, the connection was always refused
* So instead I worked on the old file, so the file I uploaded is from our beta version we turned in
* For soooome reason when we call more than 3 clients the customer number changes like hella drastically BUT
* It still counts the same, so it does actually exit the restuarant when there's one more than the amount of customers allowed...
* I'll keep working on it tomorrow, but here's what I have, and idk why I can't get the new files to work
* I hope you get trashed tonight but I may to ask you about the newer files tomorrow, and then I'll run my changes on the newer files and see if I still get the same issues.

And that is all! Server2.c kinda works, just like... in a ratchet way... but it works! Just it's ugly... so yep!
